Create a game, which is a variant of the well-known five-in-a-row game. The two players can play on a 
board consists of n x n fields. Players put their signs alternately (X and O) on the board. A sign can 
be put only onto a free field. The game ends, when the board is full, or a player won by having five 
adjacent signs in a row, column or diagonal. The program should show during the game who turns.

The trick in this variant is that if a player makes 3 adjacent signs (in a row, column or diagonal), 
then one of his signs is removed randomly (not necessary from this 3 signs). Similar happens, when the 
player makes 4 adjacent signs, but in this case two of his signs are removed.

Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (6x6, 10x10, 14x14). The game should recognize 
if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box which player won (if the game is not 
ended with draw), and automatically begin a new game.


Common requirements:
Your program should be user friendly, and easy to use. Apply object oriented concepts if it is possible. 
Multilayer architecture is not required.
Use controls to make the GUI of the game. Some assignments require to use several board sizes. 
Make sure that the window size fits everytime to the board of the game.
The documentation should contain:
	the description of the exercise,
	the class diagram,
	the short description of each methods,
	the connections between the events and event handlers,
	test cases
